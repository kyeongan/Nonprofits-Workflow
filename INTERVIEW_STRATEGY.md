## 🎪 Interview Day Strategy

### **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (5 mins)**

```
Interviewer: "Scale your nonprofit system to enterprise level"

Your Response:
"Let me clarify the requirements:
- How many foundations will use this? (multi-tenancy)
- What's the expected email volume? (1K/day vs 1M/day)
- What are the SLA requirements? (99.9% uptime?)
- Any compliance needs? (GDPR, CAN-SPAM)
- Real-time vs batch processing acceptable?"
```

### **Phase 2: High-Level Architecture (10 mins)**

```
Start with your current architecture:

Current:
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   FastAPI   │───▶│ In-Memory   │
│     App     │    │   Storage   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘

Scale to:
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│  Load        │  │   Multiple   │  │ PostgreSQL   │
│ Balancer     │─▶│   FastAPI    │─▶│   + Redis    │
│              │  │   Instances  │  │    Cache     │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
                  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
                  │  Background  │  │    Email     │
                  │   Workers    │─▶│   Service    │
                  │   (Celery)   │  │  (SendGrid)  │
                  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

### **Phase 3: Deep Dive Implementation (20 mins)**

**Focus on these key areas:**

1. **Database Design**

   ```sql
   -- Show you understand relational design
   CREATE TABLE nonprofits (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE email_campaigns (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       template TEXT NOT NULL,
       status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft'
   );
   ```

2. **Async Processing**

   ```python
   @app.post("/send-email")
   async def send_email(request: EmailRequest, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
       # Validate immediately
       campaign = await validate_and_create_campaign(request)

       # Queue for background processing
       background_tasks.add_task(process_campaign, campaign.id)

       return {"campaign_id": campaign.id, "status": "queued"}
   ```

3. **Error Handling & Retries**
   ```python
   @celery.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
   def send_email_task(self, email_data):
       try:
           return send_via_provider(email_data)
       except TemporaryFailure as e:
           raise self.retry(countdown=2 ** self.request.retries)
   ```

### **Phase 4: Scaling Discussion (10 mins)**

**Scaling Dimensions:**

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Multiple app instances
- **Database Scaling:** Read replicas, eventual sharding
- **Caching:** Redis for frequent lookups
- **Queue Scaling:** Multiple worker processes
- **Geographic:** Multi-region deployment

## 🎤 Mock Interview Responses

### Q: "Your current system stores everything in memory. How do you make it production-ready?"

**Your Answer:**
"Great question. The in-memory storage was perfect for the MVP and interviews, but has several production issues:

**Problems:**

1. Data loss on restart
2. Memory growth without bounds
3. No concurrency safety
4. Limited querying capabilities

**Solution - Database Migration:**

1. **PostgreSQL** for ACID transactions and complex queries
2. **Connection pooling** for concurrent access
3. **Proper indexing** for performance
4. **Migration strategy** using Alembic

Here's how I'd implement it..."

_[Show database schema and repository pattern]_

### Q: "How do you handle sending 100,000 emails without blocking your API?"

**Your Answer:**
"Blocking the API for large email batches would create terrible user experience. Here's my approach:

**Immediate Response Pattern:**

1. Validate request quickly (check nonprofits exist)
2. Create campaign record in database
3. Queue background job
4. Return 202 Accepted with job ID

**Background Processing:**

1. **Job Queue** (Redis + Celery)
2. **Batch Processing** (1000 emails per batch)
3. **Rate Limiting** (respect SendGrid limits)
4. **Progress Tracking** (update campaign status)

This gives users immediate feedback while processing happens async."

### Q: "What happens if SendGrid goes down?"

**Your Answer:**
"Single point of failure in email delivery is unacceptable. I'd implement:

**Multi-Provider Strategy:**

1. **Primary:** SendGrid (best integration)
2. **Fallback:** AWS SES (cost-effective)
3. **Emergency:** Mailgun (different infrastructure)

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**

- Monitor failure rates
- Automatically switch providers
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Alert on provider failures

**Implementation:**

```python
class EmailProviderManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = [SendGridProvider(), SESProvider()]
        self.current = 0

    async def send_with_fallback(self, email_data):
        for provider in self.providers:
            try:
                return await provider.send(email_data)
            except Exception:
                continue  # Try next provider
        raise AllProvidersFailedException()
```
